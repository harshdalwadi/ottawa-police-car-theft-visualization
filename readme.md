# Ottawa Police Car Theft Visualization Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Ottawa Police Service (OPS) open data** on vehicle thefts and presents the findings through three key visualizations.  

The goal was to apply best practices in **data visualization** (titles, labels, color, clarity) to turn raw data into clear and compelling insights, using **Microsoft Excel** for analysis and visualization.
